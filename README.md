# JohnCar  
A collection of car-related projects, experiments and notes.  
This repository acts as a central place to store anything automotive that I’m working on, including CAD parts, maintenance documentation, diagnostics, sensor experiments, and general mechanical tinkering.

## Overview  
JohnCar isn’t a single “project” — it’s more like a **workbench** for car-related ideas.  
If I’m testing something, designing something, researching something, or fixing something on a car, it ends up here.

This repo may include:  
- CAD models of brackets, mounts, or replacement parts  
- Maintenance logs and service notes  
- ECU / OBD-II experiments  
- Sensor testing (accelerometers, GPS logging, telemetry)  
- Custom parts for interior or exterior fittings  
- Small mechanical studies (suspension geometry, linkage behaviour, etc.)  
- Random findings, measurements and photos  

Basically: **anything car-related that doesn’t need its own repo** goes here.

## Purpose  
Cars are an endless source of mechanical and electrical learning opportunities.  
This repo exists so I can:  
- Document repairs and upgrades  
- Keep CAD files organised  
- Experiment with custom parts  
- Store measurements for future projects  
- Track ideas and test results  
- Build a personal reference of automotive knowledge  

It also helps others replicate designs, troubleshoot similar issues, or just get inspiration for their own builds.
